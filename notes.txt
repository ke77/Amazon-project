// Main idea of JS
   - Save the data
   - Generate the html
   - Make it interactive


// Use objects and arrays to organise data(data structure)


//.toFixed(2) converts a number into a string to a number of decimal places


// Scripts elements are loaded one by one, so order of file links is important


// Data attribut is just another html attribute that allows us to attach any information to an element(uses kebab case)

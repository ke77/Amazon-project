// Main idea of JS
   - Save the data
   - Generate the html
   - Make it interactive


// Use objects and arrays to organise data(data structure)


//.toFixed(2) converts a number into a string to a number of decimal places


// Scripts elements are loaded one by one, so order of file links is important


// Data attribut is just another html attribute that allows us to attach any information to an element(uses kebab case)


// Not using modules can cause naming conflicts
   _How to create a module_
    - Create a file
    - Don't load file with script tag
    - all imported variables should be declared at the top
    - has to be online to work(live server)
